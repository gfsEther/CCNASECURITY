chapter 1 - Understand Network

- 3 basic concepts = Confidentially, Integrity and Availability

- Risk management:
  asset = anything that is valuable to an organization
  vunerability = is an exploitable weakness in a system or its design
  treat = any potencial danger to an asset (latent - vunerability exist but not yet realized
                                            realized - attack already lauched to ur system and compromises yout security against an asset.
                                            threat agent/vector - the entity that takes advantage of the vunerability.)
  countermeasure = is a safeguard that somehow mitigates a potencial risk.


ASSET - An asset is an item that is to be protected and can include property, people, and information/data that have value to the company. This includes intangible items such as proprietary information or trade secrets and the reputation of the company. The data could include company records, client information, proprietary software, and so on.

VUNERABILITY - A vulnerability is an exploitable weakness of some type. That exploitation might result from a malicious attack, or it might be accidentally triggered because of a failure or weakness in the policy, implementation, or software running on the network.

THREAT - This is what you are protecting against. A threat is anything that attempts to gain unauthorized access to, compromise, destroy, or damage an asset. Threats are often realized via an attack or exploit that takes advantage of an existing vulnerability.
Threats today come in many varieties and spread more rapidly than ever before. Threats can also morph and be modified over time, and so you must be ever diligent to keep up with them.

RISK - Risk is the potential for unauthorized access to, compromise, destruction, or damage to an asset. If a threat exists, but proper countermeasures and protections are in place (it is your goal to provide this protection), the potential for the threat to be successful is reduced (thus reducing the overall risk).

COUNTERMEASURE - A countermeasure is a device or process (a safeguard) that is implemented to counteract a potential threat, which thus reduces risk.

ASSET CLASSIFICATION:
  Governmental classifications    Unclassified
                                  Sensitive but unclassified (SBU)
                                  Confidential
                                  Secret
                                  Top secret

  Private sector classifications  Public
                                  Sensitive
                                  Private
                                  Confidential
                                  
  Classification criteria         Value
                                  Age
                                  Replacement cost
                                  Useful lifetime

  Classification roles            Owner (the group ultimately responsible for the data, usually senior management of a company)
                                  Custodian (the group responsible for implementing the policy as dictated by the owner)
                                  User (those who access the data and abide by the rules of acceptable use for the data)

VUNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION:
  Policy flaws
  Design errors
  Protocol weaknesses
  Misconfiguration
  Software vulnerabilities
  Human factors
  Malicious software
  Hardware vulnerabilities
  Physical access to network resources

Dictionaty of known vunerabilities:
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
  National Vulnerability Database (NVD)

COUNTERMEASURE CLASSIFICATION:
  Administrative - These consist of written policies, procedures, guidelines, and standards. An example would be a written acceptable use policy (AUP), agreed to by each user on the network. Another example is a change control process that needs to be followed when making changes to the network. Administrative controls could involve items such as background checks for users, as well.

  Physical - Physical controls are exactly what they sound like, physical security
  for the network servers, equipment, and infrastructure. An example is providing a locked door between users and the wiring closet on any floor (where the switches and other gear exists). Another example of a physical control is a redundant system (for instance, an uninterruptible power supply).

  Logical - Logical controls include passwords, firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, access lists, VPN tunnels, and so on. Logical controls are often referred to as technical controls.

POTENCIAL ATTACKERS:
  Terrorists
  Criminals
  Government agencies
  Nation-states
  Hackers
  Disgruntled employees
  Competitors
  Anyone with access to a computing device (sad, but true)

ATTACK METHODS
  Reconnaissance - This is the discovery process used to find information about the network. It could include scans of the network to find out which IP addresses respond, and further scans to see which ports are open. This is usually the first step taken, to discover what is on the network and to determine potential vulnerabilities.

  Social engineering - This is a tough one because it leverages our weakest (very likely) vulnerability in a secure network: the user. If the attacker can get the user to reveal information, it is much easier for the attacker than using some other method of reconnaissance. This could be done through email or misdirection of web pages, which results in the user clicking something that leads to the attacker gaining information. Social engineering can also be done in person or over the phone.
    Phishing presents a link that looks like a valid trusted resource to a user. When the user clicks it, the user is prompted to disclose confidential information such as usernames/passwords.
    Pharming is used to direct a customerâ€™s URL from a valid resource to a malicious one that could be made to appear as the valid site to the user. From there, an attempt is made to extract confidential information from the user.

  Privilege escalation - This is the process of taking some level of access (whether authorized or not) and achieving an even greater level of access. An example is an attacker who gains user mode access to a router and then uses a brute- force attack against the router, determining what the enable secret is for privilege level 15 access.

  Back doors - When attackers gain access to a system, they usually want future access, as well, and they want it to be easy. A backdoor application can be installed to either allow future access or to collect information to use in further attacks.
  Many back doors are installed by users clicking something without realizing the link they click or the file they open is a threat. Back doors can also be implemented as a result of a virus or a worm (often referred to as malware).
